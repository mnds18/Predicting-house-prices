# Predicting-house-prices
This is part of project for Coursera course on Machine Learning


We are using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...).
We are trying to build a more accurate regression model for predicting house prices by including more features of the house and increasing accuracy
